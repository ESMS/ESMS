Attendance can be marked by clicking on the Attendance Button, or by right clicking on a student and then clicking on Attendance. Thus Attendance can be entered into the system in bulk as well as per individual student. In either of the case, the admin can mark the Attendance using the arrow keys to move the selected area and press space to mark Attendance.
