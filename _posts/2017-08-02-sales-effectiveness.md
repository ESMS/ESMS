Fees can be added by clicking on the Fees Button, or by right clicking on a student and then clicking on Fees. Thus Fees can be entered into the system in bulk as well as per individual student. In either of the case, the admin can tick the Fees using the arrow keys to move the selected area and press space to move to Tick.
