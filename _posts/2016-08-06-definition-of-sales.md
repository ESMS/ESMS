Marks can be added by clicking on the Marks Button, or by right clicking on a student and then clicking on marks. Thus Marks can be entered into the system in bulk as well as per individual student. In either of the case, the admin can enter the marks using the arrow keys to move the selected area and press enter to move to edit mode. After changing the values, the admin can press the enter again to save the changes made.

The user can make use of the "generate result" feature to generate the results of selected students in the main student panel. The result Excel Spreadsheet is generated at the desktop.
