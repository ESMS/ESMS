Teachers can be tracked by clicking on the teachers button on the main panel. Teachers can be added and removed by the admin in the teachers panel. The code in the teachers panel can be used to 'login' to the provided app by the teachers so that they can manage their classrooms and the respective subjects that they teach. 

To add a teacher, his/her authority must be defined. This means, whether or not the teacher has the authority to mark the attendance of a classroom. By choosing "none" in place of authority, the option of attendance will be removed from the app when logged in via the teacher's code. 

All teachers can mark their students via the App provided. They can mark the students their respective subjects.
